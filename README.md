# iOS Swift OpenCV RTSP Image Processing
This repository contains a project designed to process frames captured from an RTSP camera connection and the device's camera, leveraging OpenCV and C++ compiled into native code. A simple filter is applied to the frames using OpenCV with C++, enabling image processing while facilitating interaction with Swift project files. These files are seamlessly integrated and used within the C++ code.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you will need the following:

1. **OpenCV Framework for iOS and Swift:** OpenCV is required for image processing. You can download the appropriate version for iOS from the [OpenCV SourceForge page](https://sourceforge.net/projects/opencvlibrary/). Make sure to verify the compatibility of the version you select with your development environment.

1. **MobileVLCKit Framework:** MobileVLCKit is necessary for capturing RTSP streams. You can find the desired release version on the [MobileVLCKit artifacts page](https://artifacts.videolan.org/VLCKit/MobileVLCKit/). Ensure the version you choose aligns with your project requirements.
